# R: A Hitchhikers Guide to Reproducible Research
Research is hard. Faced with an ocean of information, it is difficult to steer a course through the waves and arrive at the sun-kissed shores of new knowledge. 

But how did we get there and can we find our way back if required?

Reproducible research benefits everyone, but most of all it benefits you. It allows you to remember what you did a year ago, a month ago, or even yesterday. It gives you certainty that the findings you make are based on solid foundations, but perhaps even more importantly it allows mistakes to be disovered and corrected.

Reproducible research practices may seem like an additional workload but in reality it is work you are already doing and just not documenting. Research funders recognise this and the emphasis is no longer solely on the papers, but on the data and the process. This set of notes pulls together my take on adopting reproducible research into my work over the past two years with the [Clinical Research Facility - Cork](https://crfc.ucc.ie). It is by no means complete, but it's increasing every year (as can be seen from a cursory glance at my repository history!). 

Many of the topics covered are day-to-day tasks that depend solely on the increasingly scarce resource of common sense! Hopefully the R notes/scripts/worksheets will takes things a big step further towards reproducible research using R/RStudio and scripted workflows
