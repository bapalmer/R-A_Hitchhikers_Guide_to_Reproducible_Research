## Goal

For this task we will construct a generic folder/filing structure that aligns with our own work.

## Tasks

1. Write 2-3 basic R scripts that;

    a. Read in the data to your environment
    b. Uses ggplot to generate a simple figure
    c. Creates a simple table summarising the data

2. Link the R script that will read in your data to the other R scripts for plotting and summarising the data using the `source()` function

3. Attempt to link individual lines of code into chunks using `%>%`
