## Goal

For this task we will attempt to bring together what we have learned

## Tasks

1. Create a R Markdown document to report on some element of the project you have created.

    a. Plot a simple graph
    b. Include a simple table
    c. Write a few lines of text
    d. Attempt to include some R outputs in your text

2. Knit your project report and day it in docs using `render`.

3. Zip your completed test project and email to [Brendan](b.palmer@ucc.ie) so  that he can check that it is reproducible.
