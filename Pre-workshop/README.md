# R: A Hitchhikers Guide to Reproducible Research

## Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3, testing

Welcome to a beginners course for R, taught through the lens of reproducible research

If you are yet to use R on your system an install guide is provided in 'docs/R-RStudio_installation_steps.pdf'. At the time of writing, the current
version of R is 3.6.1.

If you already have R installed but need to update it, follow the steps provided in the R_update_presentation.pdf. Better to do this via the R GUI,
rather than in the RStudio GUI. 

## Once R and RStudio are installed, check that the following works...

**In RStudio, open the testing_testing R-project file (.Rproj)**
> File
> Open Project...
> testing_testing.Rproj

**Next open and run testing_testing.R R script.**
> File
> Open File...
> testing_testing.R

Click on the run button to run each line of code. If your RStudio session mirrors in the PDF setup file, GREAT!
