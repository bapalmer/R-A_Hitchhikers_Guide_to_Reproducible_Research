# The power of R is derived from the packages that can be loaded and run

# The steps below will help you load a package and navigate through 
# some of the package contents

# 1. You need to load packages at the start of each new session
# Type library(tidyverse) into the console below

# "library()" is a function that will load installed packages

# Note any messages that get displayed as the tidyverse loads

# 2. Type "dplyr::" and scroll through the list of functions/data

# 3. Access additional information by typing "?" followed by the function
# e.g. "?dplyr::select"

# 4. You can also get more information on the sample data sets by using "?"
# Type "?mpg" into the console

# 5. R IS CASE SENSITIVE

# Type "r <- 5"
# Type "r" and hit return

# Type "R" and hit return

# 6. You can access example data from the 'datasets' package
