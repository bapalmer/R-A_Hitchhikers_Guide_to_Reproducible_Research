# This is the beginning of the project

## Data overview

The plot below is created directly from the code I wrote in the scripts

```{r packages and setup, include = FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, 
                      fig.width  = 6, fig.height = 4)

# The clean data file is called within each of the plots and analysis scripts
# source("example_project/scripts/03_pm_clean_data.R")

# To get the output to save in the docs folder use:
# rmarkdown::render('all_together.now', output_file = 'docs/example_project_report.docx') in the console
# If you jutst click the knit button, it will save alongside the Rmd file

# Load your packages here  
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r Plots, echo = FALSE}

source("scripts/02_eg_figures.R")

# The location of the Rmd file dictates whether the path to other files is intact

```

This table summarises the TB data for four countries with similar population sizes.

```{r Analysis, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
source("scripts/03_eg_analysis.R")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Country comparison for 0-14 year old cohort ----
kable(table_of_info, caption = "Table 1. Summary of TB cases in four countries")
```
