## Background 

UV wavelengths are a natural part of the solar spectrum and are associated with the accumulation of various plant polyphenols such as
 flavonoids and anthocyanins, as well as changes in plant architecture. Studies have shown strong association between the consumption of 
 plant polyphenols and a milieu of human-health benefits including protective functions against chronic diseases and obesity. 

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of natural UV radiation on the bronze lettuce with a focus on potential increases 
in the nutritional and monetary value of the end-product.
