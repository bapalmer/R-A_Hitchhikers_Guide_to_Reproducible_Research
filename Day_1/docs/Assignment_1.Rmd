## Goal

For this task we will construct a generic folder/filing structure that aligns with our own work.

## Tasks

1. Create a new folder on your harddrive

    a. Give it an informative machine- and human-readable name
    a. Create a subfolder for data/raw data
    b. Create a subfolder to hold your R scripts
    c. Create further folders that will hold the range of files you will be creating
    
2. Create a R-project file to associate with the folder structure
    
3. Place a raw data file in the data/raw_data folder

    a. This can be a 'messy' data file you wish to work on
    b. This can be a file that comes with a R package
